            This paper proposes a critical reading of <i>Despotism in China</i>, a rich but less well-commented argumentative text in which Quesnay explicitly presents his political theory. By analyzing <i>Despotism in China</i>, I give support to three main arguments. First, I show to what extent this text embodies Quesnay's thought (and, broadly speaking, the physiocrats' thought). Second, I highlight that economics as an activity, a field, and even a science, lies at the heart of Quesnay's political philosophy. Third, I indicate that, according to Quesnay, the understanding of economics mechanisms corresponds to a close observation of reality, which consists in bringing together the positive law (politics based on economics) and the natural law (what is and what should be).  At the core of these three arguments lies a serious consideration of Quesnay's re-presentation of China. Far from being a mere example to illustrate its arguments, China is conceived as way to see, to reveal, and to grasp a thought (physiocracy), a discipline (economics), and its reach (science and politics).
