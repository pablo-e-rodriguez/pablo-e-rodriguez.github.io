<p>
  I am the co-author of some Stata packages. They can all be downloaded through ssc. Please reach out if you have any comments or suggestions!
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    number_exporting <i>(with Olena Bogdan, Adrien Matray, and Chenzi Xu)</i><br>
    Format a given numeric value produced in Stata based on user specifications. It outputs the formatted number into a .tex file that can then be called directly into the paper or document you are working on.<br>
  </li>

<li>
    winsor4 <i>(with Adrien Matray)</i><br>
Trim or winsorize a variable based on outliers defined by either percentiles or interquartile range.<br>
  </li>

  <li>
    evstudydd <i>(with Adrien Matray)</i><br>
    Estimate event studies in D-i-D settings using the reghdfe or ppmlhdfe packages.<br> 
evstudydd produces all the point estimates and standard errors, together with a time indicator, and saves them in a .dta file, which can then be merged or appended with other files to produce more flexible graphs.<br>
  </li>
  
</ul>
