I am the co-author of some Stata packages. They can all be downloaded through ssc. Please reach out if you have any comments or suggestions!

 <li>
        number_exporting<br>
        Format a given numeric value produced in Stata based on user specifications. It outputs the formatted number into a LaTeX compatible
    .tex file that can then be called directly into the paper or document you are working on.<br>
